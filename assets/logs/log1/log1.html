               I've always been a fan of tabletop card games and board games 
               and creating my own has always interested me. These logs will 
               follow my attempt at creating one and hopefully lead to a 
               successful game one day. The idea here isn't to make millions 
               straight away but to learn as much as I can about the whole 
               process.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Overtime I would write my ideas down on my phone, building up 
                a collection of themes and concepts. What I found at this stage
                 was if I didn't stop and attempt to create a prototype then I'll
                 be at this stage forever. The truth was I wouldn't know if I was
                  happy with the concept until I tested it.

                The Beginning Of An Idea
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                I picked what I think is my simplest idea and I decided to create
                 an initial rules document, detailing the minimum requirements. I
                  tried not to get too carried away with all these weird and 
                  wonderful rules and mechanics. For now the simpler the better. 
                  What I landed on was a simple potion recipe making game, the 
                  general concept was some cards represent recipes and some 
                  ingredients. Players would have to collect the required ingredients
                   to complete a number of recipes before the other players. You can
                    find my initial rules draft 
                    <a target="_blank" attribute href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nrQfC4TfvSAfs3Szyh17cfmqnrw9mivx6r_q8h54P2I/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
                The theme I decided to start with was a scaly theme, I opted for 
                   potion names and ingredients which would be suited to a world 
                   ruled by lizards.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
               Now I had my draft of rules and a rough theme, I decided to list out
                some names, types and effects for potential cards. I have about 50 
                recipes, 50 ingredients and 50 actions. I narrowed this down for a 
                final draft as I'd be simulating a 2 player game. 
                You can find the cards that I settled on <a target="_blank" attribute href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dGmK5Tc2bpGc3-klLbIvZK3p9WVWcDYEcjrAzF8uKKg/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
